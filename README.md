<p>This exercise write tests and codes to pass the test.</p>

<p>Compare and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. Follow through the test to produce the perfect function that accounts for all expectations.

For strings, return its length.
For null or undefined return string 'no value'
For booleans return the boolean
For numbers return a string showing how it compares to hundred e.g. For 67 return 'less than 100' for 4034 return 'more than 100' or equal to 100 as the case may be
For arrays return the 3rd index, or undefined if it doesn't exist.
For functions call the function and pass in true as an argument and return it.</p>
<p>Write a getPrimes function that takes an integer value n as argument and generates prime numbers from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis. The generated prime numbers should be in an array. Your logic should be as efficient as possible (with minimal iterations).</p>
